lua_nrepl_client
================

This a Clojure nREPL client written in Lua. It implements almost all OP codes of 
Clojure nREPL messages(except for ":load-file" & ":interrupt").

Please be aware of this implementation use nREPL's default encoding "bencode" to
encode/decode messages between client and nREPL server.

0. 	PREPARE: 
    have your nREPL server started; make sure file clj_client.lua & bencode.lua
    under your lua path.
    
1. 	RUN:
    In Lua console, type following:
        a) cljc=require("clj_client").start_clj_client
        b) cljc(host,port) -- replace the host & port to your real nREPL environment 

2.  PLAY:
    When you see a prompt like "user=>: ", you can now try typing some Clojure code 
    to send(e.g. "*ns*").
    User input starting with an exclamation mark(!) means special command. Special 
    commands are usually special nREPL OPerations(e.g. "!session" for ":sessions" OP), 
    or configuration command(e.g. "!timeout 0.1" is to set timeout to 0.1 second), or,
    to make it's more interesting, I just had it also kind of Lua code executable 
    under "!". 
    To sum up:
        * ! - list current configuration
        * !q - quite client
        * !sessions - list current sessions in nREPL server
        * !ver - list nREPL version info
        * !ops - list nREPL supported OPs
        * !showraw - switch to make client to/not-to show non-decoded messages received from server
        * !shownaked - switch to make client to/not-to show non-explained messages received from server
        * !timeout xx - set timeout to xx seconds (when waiting for server's response)
        * !retries xx - set retries to xx times (when waiting for server's response)
        * !some-lua-code - try to execute Lua code

I just wrote this tool for fun & to study some new thing, so I may not update this kit that frequently. 
If you have any ideas or requirements(or found any bugs), please just let me know (yes I will try to 
solve them).

Have Fun!
